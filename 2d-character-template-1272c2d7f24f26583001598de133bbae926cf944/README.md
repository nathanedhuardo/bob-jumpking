# What is this?
This project contains basic functionality for 2D character controllers with a fully functional example.

The repository includes its own state machine system which will be documented soon<sup>tm</sup>.

There are two branches of node classes building the system, states and transitions, I've done my best to make them self explanatory and tried adding a good amount of quality of life features in the editor itself.

Have fun making games!
